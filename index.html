<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to OTB.
</h3>

<p>OTB is a software engineering conference which will take place in Greece. Our inspiration comes from the UK-based <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/ot2000/">OT</a> (later renamed <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/">SPA</a>) conferences which have been taking place since 1993. As we say, OTB is going to be a kind of 'olde OT-clone'. Imitation is the highest form of flattery as they say.</p>

<pre><code>The whole point of the OTB conference is "Learning"!
</code></pre>

<p>With OTB we are exploring the technologies and practice of software engineering using a practical and experience-based approach. OTB is built around highly interactive workshops rather than tutorials and lectures. In this environment the participants get to do all the fun work! At OTB experts get to learn from novices and vice versa. </p>
	
<p>Participants come to OTB to become better software engineers and do so by sharing and digesting their experiences.</p>

</h3>
<p>
	In order to make OTB possible and test-drive our ideas we have decided to run 'mini-OTB' on Saturday January 25th 2014 in Athens, Greece. Yes, we're that agile :-).

</h3>

<p>
The OTB committee is mentored by Bruce Anderson, one of the fathers of the OT conferences. As Bruce tells us "You are a machine, and I am merely some oil to help it run better".

<h4><a name="about-bruce" class="anchor" href="#about-bruce"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bruce Anderson</h4>
<p>
	Bruce worked for 20 years as a university teacher and researcher, and 15 years as a consultant and software architect at IBM. Bruce was a professor of computer science at University of Essex where he investigated principles of architecture and software design. He has bicycled around the world, climbed the tallest trees in America, and meditated to the fifth level of enlightenment. He asks very good questions, is a kind leader, and is a friend to ducks everywhere.
</p>

<p>You'll find Bruce on page 'xi' of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">"Design Patterns"</a> book and in the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HistoryOfPatterns">History of Patterns</a></p>
<p>		
	Bruce didn't realise he was more of an engineer than a scientist until he was about 29 years old. By then he had an Oxford MA (in Physics), an Edinburgh MSc (in Artificial Intelligence), a couple of years in the US mainly at the Stanford AI Lab, a year in CS at Essex doing AI, and a new job in the Essex Electronics department. Then he worked as a Senior Managing Consultant in IBM Global Services (techie branch), where he shared, applied and developed his ideas. 
<p>
<p>	
Now he is retired, doing almost no IT, and keeping busy without being paid.
</p>

<p>
	Bruce worked in many kinds of organisation and many different industries, in many roles, but his abiding interest is in learning and "what practitioners know". He initiated a series of workshops on the "Architecture Handbook", playing a part in the early days of the Patterns movement. Bruce has run many learning workshops, including several pan-European interactive events with a highly participative and empowering style for 160 participants. Jointly with Steve Cook Bruce led the creation of the OT (now SPA) series of conferences in the UK (now in their twentieth year), and have run several OOPSLA workshops.
<p>

<p>
	Bruce knows that people love to collaborate and learn together, and from each other, when they are free to do so - free from unnecessary pressure and free from false models of learning and knowledge. Such people enjoy life and work productively.
