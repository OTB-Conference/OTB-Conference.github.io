<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to OTB
</h3>

<p>OTB is a software engineering conference that will take place in Greece. Its inspiration comes from the <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/ot2000/">OT</a> conferences (later renamed to <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/">SPA</a>), taking place in the UK since 1997. OTB is going to be a kind of 'olde OT-clone'; imitation is the highest form of flattery, right?</p>

<pre><code>The whole point of the OTB conference is "Learning"!
</code></pre>

<p>With OTB we are exploring the technologies and practices of software engineering using a practical and experience-based approach. OTB is built around highly interactive workshops rather than tutorials and lectures. In this environment, the participants get to do all the fun work! At OTB, experts and novices alike create ideas together and learn from each other.</p>

<p>Participants come to OTB to become better software engineers and they do so by sharing and digesting their experiences.</p>

</h3>

<p>In order to make OTB possible and test-drive our ideas we're going to run a 'mini-OTB' on Saturday, January 25th 2014 in Athens, Greece. Yes, we're that agile :).<p>

	John and Panos will present a set of ideas and supporting material to start the workshop on development environments. Participants will use these along with their own experience to see how to improve their productivity. All aspects of the environment are included (language, editor, IDE, toolchain, etc). Please bring a laptop if you can.

</h3>

<p>
The OTB committee is mentored by Bruce Anderson, one of the fathers of the OT conferences. As Bruce tells us "You are a machine, and I am merely some oil to help it run better".

  <p>
    is one of the redshirt survivors of EuRuKo 2013 and co-founder of <a href="https://github.com/thessaloniki/rb">thessaloniki.rb</a> and has been pretending - somewhat successfully - to be an embedded software developer for over a dozen years now.</br>
    Working for <a href="http://www.zuehlke.com">Zühlke</a>, he invents ways to introduce Ruby and the joys of devops to industry giants like Siemens, Lenze, Roche or Liebherr bridging the world of the web and the cloud with the physical reality of embedded devices.

  <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPagonis" class="user-mention">John Pagonis</a></h5> 
  <p>
    invested too many (he thinks) years developing smartphone OS software so now he is having fun with machine learning and recommender systems.  When he grows up he wants to become a good software engineer and score a win over information overload.

  <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/dipapan" class="user-mention">Dimitris Papanikolaou</a></h5>
  <p>
    wanted to be a musician but in the end another type of keyboard won his heart. He has been programming for over 20 years, having started with assembly and worked all his way up to smartphone application development. Being an avid learner of all things software he seeks opportunities to be taught and occasionally teach others.

    used to program his Apple //e in hex when his friends were boasting about their CGA cards. He still likes to poke into and program the devices he owns. His next goal is to wrap his head around Haskell, on some real world smartphone app preferably...

<h4><a name="about-bruce" class="anchor" href="#about-bruce"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bruce Anderson</h4>
<p>
	Bruce worked for 20 years as a university teacher and researcher and 15 years as a consultant and software architect at IBM. He was a professor of computer science at University of Essex where he investigated principles of architecture and software design. He has bicycled around the world, climbed the tallest trees in America and meditated to the fifth level of enlightenment. He asks very good questions, is a kind leader and a friend to ducks everywhere.
</p>

<p>You'll find Bruce on page 'xi' of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">"Design Patterns"</a> book and in the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HistoryOfPatterns">History of Patterns</a></p>
<p>		
	Bruce didn't realise he was more of an engineer than a scientist until he was about 29 years old. By then, he had an Oxford MA (in Physics), an Edinburgh MSc (in Artificial Intelligence), a couple of years in the US mainly at the Stanford AI Lab, a year in CS at Essex doing AI and a new job in the Essex Electronics department. He then worked as a Senior Managing Consultant in IBM Global Services (techie branch) where he shared, applied and developed his ideas. 
<p>
<p>
Now he's retired, doing almost no IT and keeping busy without being paid.
</p>

<p>
	Bruce worked in many kinds of organisations and many different industries, in many roles, but his abiding interest is in learning and "what practitioners know". He initiated a series of workshops on the "Architecture Handbook", playing a part in the early days of the Patterns movement. Bruce has run many learning workshops, including several pan-European interactive events with a highly participative and empowering style for 160 participants. Jointly with Steve Cook Bruce led the creation of the OT (now SPA) series of conferences in the UK (now in their twentieth year), and have run several OOPSLA workshops.
<p>

<p>
	Bruce knows that people love to collaborate and learn together and from each other, when they are free to do so - free from unnecessary pressure and free from false models of learning and knowledge. Such people enjoy life and work productively.
